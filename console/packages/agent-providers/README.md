# @switch-console/agent-providers

Provider adapters that drive coding agents over their native SDKs and
protocols. These five adapters are the only Console session runtime.

## Shape

- `src/adapter.ts` — the `ProviderAdapter` interface every provider implements.
  One adapter instance drives many sessions, keyed by Switch's session id.
- `src/events.ts` — the normalized `ProviderRuntimeEvent` stream. Orchestration,
  status derivation and the transcript UI consume only this; vendor payloads
  ride along in `raw` for debugging.
- `src/testing/` — the conformance suite (`describeConformance`) that every
  adapter runs against the real provider, plus `EventRecorder`.
- `src/acp/` — the generic Agent Client Protocol adapter every ACP-speaking
  CLI runs on, and the `AcpProviderHooks` a CLI supplies.
- `src/providers/registry.ts` — `PROVIDER_RUNTIMES`, the one list of providers
  the execution host can run: each entry's adapter, sign-in check and login
  command.
- `src/<provider>/` — one directory per provider. For an ACP CLI this is only
  its hooks.

## Transports (decided, do not relitigate per adapter)

| Provider | Transport | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `opencode` | `opencode serve` spawned per session, driven with `@opencode-ai/sdk` over HTTP + SSE | Sessions are server-side; permissions and questions are answerable over the API. One server per session because OpenCode stores MCP registrations per directory and Switch registers an MCP server per session. |
| `claude` | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` in streaming-input mode, one long-lived query per session | Mid-turn messages queue into the live loop; `canUseTool` carries both approvals and `AskUserQuestion`; sessions share the CLI's transcript files so `--resume` interoperates. |
| `codex` | `codex app-server` JSON-RPC over stdio | The Codex SDK wraps `codex exec`, which cannot answer approvals. app-server can, and supports `turn/steer`, `thread/resume` and `turn/interrupt`. |
| `antigravity` | `antigravity-acp`, ACP over stdio, on the generic ACP adapter | Native sessions, resume, model selection through a `model` config option, MCP registration, approvals and questions. |
| `cursor` | `agent acp`, ACP over stdio, on the generic ACP adapter | Native sessions, model catalogue, MCP registration and approvals, plus Cursor's question, plan, todo and task extensions. |
| any new ACP CLI | ACP over stdio, on the generic ACP adapter | Write hooks, not an adapter: see [Add an agent provider](../../docs/add-an-agent-provider.md). |

## Rules for an adapter

- Map the vendor's permission model onto `RuntimeMode` inside the adapter.
  `full-access` must never surface a `request.opened` for ordinary work.
- Emit `turn.started` and exactly one `turn.completed` per turn id the caller
  passed in. A steered message reuses the running turn and reports it in
  `steeredInto`.
- Every `request.opened` and `user-input.requested` must be answerable through
  the adapter until the session stops; auto-resolve them with `cancel` on stop.
- Spawned processes get exactly `input.env`; do not merge `process.env`.
- Throw `ProviderSessionError` for a dead or unknown session, never return a
  boolean. Emit `session.exited` when the vendor process or server goes away.
- Log at warning for degraded-but-working, and emit `runtime.warning` so the
  UI can show it.

## Running the conformance suite

```bash
cd console/packages/agent-providers
pnpm test:integration                                   # all providers, sequential
pnpm exec vitest run src/opencode/opencode.integration.test.ts   # one provider
```

The suite skips itself when the provider binary or login is missing and says
why. It spends real tokens. Passing a path after `pnpm test:integration --`
does not filter; use `pnpm exec vitest run <file>` for one provider.

## Known provider limits (verified 2026-09-05)

| Provider | Version | Conformance | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| opencode | 1.18.27 | 10/10 | Auto-answers doom-loop and subagent asks in `full-access` with `once`, never `always` (OpenCode remembers `always` per directory). Config isolation only via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. |
| claude | 2.1.260 | 10/10 | `AskUserQuestion` is offered to a session **only while a `canUseTool` callback is registered** — in `default` and `bypassPermissions` alike — so the adapter registers one in every mode and filters the SDK's `CLAUDE_SDK_CAN_USE_TOOL_SHADOWED` warning rather than obeying it. A mid-turn message is queued after the running turn, not folded into it; the adapter keeps the turn open until every queued send is answered. |
| codex | 0.153.2 | 9/10 | `request_user_input` only works in Plan mode, so `user-input` is skipped. Subagents need `--enable multi_agent_v2`. `turn/steer` joins the running turn. |
| antigravity (ACP) | antigravity-acp 1.1.1 | 9/10 (2026-10-11) | `subagent` is skipped: `invoke_subagent` runs past the 300 s deadline, on main's adapter as on the generic one. `mcp-registered` passes on the generic adapter and timed out on main's. |
| openhands (ACP) | 1.16.0 | 9/10 (2026-11-05) | `user-input` is skipped: the agent has no ask-the-user tool and asks in prose. Its MCP tool calls name no server, so one counts as the session's own only while the session registered a single MCP server and OpenHands has none of its own in `mcp.json`; otherwise it asks in approval-required like any other action. The model is the one in `~/.openhands/agent_settings.json` (`session/set_model` is a no-op and `acp` ignores `--override-with-envs`): the session lists that model and warns when another is asked for. Signed in means those settings exist. An interrupt ends the turn, but a tool already running finishes first: its cancel pauses the conversation between steps. Needs the `uv tool install` build (see below). |
| cursor (ACP) | 2026.10.01 | not recorded | The account used hit Cursor's usage limit, so no model turn ran. Set `CURSOR_API_KEY` in the shell to run the suite with a key; the test passes it through. |
| antigravity (retired `agy` adapter, kept for history) | 1.2.4 | 7/10 | Headless `agy` has no prompt channel at all: a tool that needs permission is auto-denied, so `approval-required` and `approval-declined` are skipped and the mode emits a `runtime.warning` at session start. `ask_question` is skipped by the CLI, so `user-input` is skipped. No steering — a mid-turn message queues as its own turn. No in-process cancel: an interrupt kills the process and the next turn respawns on `--conversation`. File tools run in the CLI's own scratch workspace unless `--add-dir <cwd>` is passed. Attachments are passed as file paths in the prompt text: the stream-json input accepts `text` blocks only and rejects `image`. Outside `full-access` a staged attachment is unreadable until its directory is passed as another `--add-dir`, which only takes effect at launch, so such a turn respawns first. A file the `download_attachment` Switch tool fetches lands under `~/.switch/sessions/<runtime pid>/media`, a directory named after a process the adapter never sees and created mid-turn, so outside `full-access` the session is given `~/.switch/sessions` at spawn and those downloads are readable without a respawn. |

## ACP providers

Cursor, Antigravity and OpenHands run on one adapter, `src/acp/acp-adapter.ts`, which
covers the protocol and chooses behaviour from what the agent advertises in
`initialize` and `session/new`:

- resume uses `session/load` when the agent advertises `loadSession`, else
  `session/resume` when it advertises `sessionCapabilities.resume`, else asks
  the host for a fresh conversation;
- a `model` select in the session's config options is set with
  `session/set_config_option`; otherwise `session/set_model` is used against
  the session's `models` list. An agent that runs the model in its own
  settings (`settingsModel`) lists that model alone and warns when another is asked for;
- attachments go as `image`, `audio` or embedded `resource` blocks only where
  the agent (or its hooks) says it takes them, else as `resource_link`.

Everything else that differs between CLIs is in its hooks file
(`src/cursor/cursor-adapter.ts`, `src/antigravity/antigravity-adapter.ts`,
`src/openhands/openhands-acp.ts`):
binary and arguments, the `authenticate` method, the mode for each runtime
mode, how a tool call names its MCP server, sign-in checks, and vendor
extensions.

Permission requests follow one policy for every ACP agent. A tool on an MCP
server the session registered is allowed once without asking, as is
everything in `full-access` and edits in `auto-accept-edits`. Otherwise the
person is offered allow once, allow for this session and reject; options
naming a permanent or future policy are never offered. An agent whose request
confirms every tool call it has announced and not run (`confirmsOpenToolCalls`)
is held to the same policy over each of those calls, and the request is shown
as them rather than as its own title.

**Cursor** extensions: `cursor/ask_question` (several questions, multi-select),
`cursor/create_plan` (an approval with the plan as its detail),
`update_todos`, `task` and `generate_image`, each with and without the ACP `_`
prefix. The CLI and default model used for verification did not expose its
AskQuestion tool, so `user-input` is skipped in its conformance run.

**Antigravity** runs in its own profile directory (`GEMINI_HOME`), set up for
OAuth on first use. Its questions arrive as permission requests whose tool
call id starts with `interaction_`. Native session ids are stored with an
`acp:` prefix; a conversation saved by the retired `agy` runtime starts fresh.
Its sign-in check reads `authMethods` from the handshake and never calls
`authenticate`, which would open a browser.

**OpenHands** (`openhands acp`) runs the LLM saved in its own settings,
`~/.openhands/agent_settings.json` (or `$OPENHANDS_PERSISTENCE_DIR`), and its
sign-in check is whether that file names a model: its ACP server refuses a
session without it, and its one auth method signs in to OpenHands Cloud, which
a local session does not use. 1.16 ignores `session/set_model` and does not
apply `--override-with-envs` in ACP mode, so the session lists that model and
warns when another is asked for. It asks for permission once for the actions it has queued, as
"Confirm Agent Actions" naming none of them, so the card shows those actions.
Its task tool (`TaskAction`) is typed as a subagent. An MCP call names no server, so it is taken as on the session's server only when that is the one server the session registered and OpenHands loads none of its own from `mcp.json`. Its ACP server passes an
HTTP MCP server's headers on in ACP's list form, which its own MCP
configuration rejects, failing every prompt of a session that has one; so the
Switch tools reach it through a stdio relay (`src/acp/mcp-relay.ts`) that the
adapter writes for the session, with the headers in an owner-only file rather
than in OpenHands' configuration, which it saves with each conversation.
It also opens stdio with Python's 64 KiB line limit rather than the ACP
library's 50 MB, and a session's first prompt, which carries the Switch skill,
is longer, so it is launched on its own Python with a short shim that opens
stdio with the library's limit (`OPENHANDS_ACP_SHIM`). That needs the
`uv tool install` build; its single-file binary is refused at launch.
The same shim lets a turn end on a reply with no text. OpenHands answers one
by telling the model it forgot a tool call; in a room, where the agent has
already posted its reply with `post_message`, the model then posts it again.
If OpenHands moves either thing the shim patches, the session fails to start
saying which, rather than running unpatched.
