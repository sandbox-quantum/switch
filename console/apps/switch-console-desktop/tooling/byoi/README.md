# Switch Console BYOI Testing Kit

A copy-pasteable setup for testing Switch Console's BYOI (Bring Your Own Infrastructure) feature.
Each task gets its own Docker container running a full Linux dev environment with Node.js, git, tmux, and Claude Code pre-installed.

## How it works

1. When you create a task, Switch Console runs `provision.sh`
2. The script builds a Docker image (first run only), starts a new container, clones your repo into it, and prints a JSON object to stdout
3. Switch Console SSH-connects to the container using password auth and opens the workspace at `/home/devuser/workspace`
4. When you terminate the task, Switch Console runs `terminate.sh` which stops and removes the container

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) running on your machine
- `jq` for JSON output — install with `brew install jq` on macOS

## Setup

Copy these files into the root of the repo you want to test with:

```
Dockerfile
entrypoint.sh
scripts/
  provision.sh
  terminate.sh
switchdash.json.example  →  rename to .switchdash.json
```

Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/provision.sh scripts/terminate.sh
```

Add the project in Switch Console, then create a task. That's it.

## First provision

The first provision builds the Docker image (~2-3 minutes, one-time). Subsequent provisions start a new container and clone the repo (~10-20 seconds).

## Provision output

The provision script must print only one JSON object to stdout. Send logs and progress messages to stderr.

This sample prints:

| Field          | Value                          | Notes                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | Docker container name          | Passed to `terminate.sh` as `REMOTE_WORKSPACE_ID`                |
| `host`         | `localhost`                    | Host Switch Console connects to                                   |
| `port`         | Random Docker host port for 22 | Must be a JSON number                                            |
| `username`     | `devuser`                      | SSH username                                                     |
| `password`     | `devpass`                      | SSH password                                                     |
| `worktreePath` | `/home/devuser/workspace`      | Repository path inside the container                             |
| `forwardAgent` | `false`                        | JSON boolean; set the script constant to `"true"` to enable it   |

## Forwarding API keys

The provision script forwards API keys from your host environment into the container automatically. Just make sure the relevant variables are set in your shell before Switch Console runs the provision script:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

To add more keys, edit the `docker run` call in `scripts/provision.sh` and the `AGENT_VARS` list in `entrypoint.sh`.

## Container credentials

- **Username:** `devuser`
- **Password:** `devpass`
- **Workspace path:** `/home/devuser/workspace`

Change the password in `Dockerfile` (`devuser:devpass`) and `scripts/provision.sh` (`CONTAINER_PASS`) if needed.

## SSH agent forwarding

This sample sets `"forwardAgent"` from the `FORWARD_AGENT` script constant. It defaults to `"false"`.

Change `FORWARD_AGENT` to `"true"` if Git commit signing or nested SSH/Git commands need your local SSH agent inside the container. Only enable forwarding for BYOI hosts you trust.

## Cleanup

Containers are removed automatically when a task is terminated. To manually clean up any leftover containers:

```bash
docker ps --filter label=switch-console.purpose=byoi-workspace
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter label=switch-console.purpose=byoi-workspace)
```

To remove the cached Docker image and force a rebuild on the next provision:

```bash
docker rmi switch-console-byoi-workspace
```
