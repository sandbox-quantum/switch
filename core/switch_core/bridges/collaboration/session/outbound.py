"""Putting a request card in a channel, and keeping it in step afterwards.

The inbound half turns a press into a command; this is the other side of it. A
card is posted once and then edited in place as the request moves open →
submitting → resolved or closed, so the channel carries one message per request
rather than a running commentary.

Posting is also what makes the inbound half reachable at all: the row written
here is the only thing a token, a handle or a reply to a card ever resolves to.

Slack-shaped, for the same reason `post_blocks` is: Block Kit is Slack's own
form and the platforms that need something like a card need something
different. The neutral seam belongs here when a second platform wants one, not
before.
