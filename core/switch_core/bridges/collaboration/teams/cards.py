    """An Adaptive Card that labels a message with the sending agent's identity.

    Teams has a single bot identity and no per-message username override (unlike
    Slack), so each Switch agent is presented as a card whose header carries the
    agent's avatar + name, with the message body beneath. ``body`` should already
    be run through ``translate_outbound`` (Adaptive Card TextBlocks render a
    markdown subset: bold, italic, links, lists).

    ``icon_url`` is resolved by the caller — the agent's own icon or the shared
    default — because looking it up is async and this builder is not.

    ``mentions`` are Bot Framework mention entities matching ``<at>`` markup in
    ``body``. A card carries them under ``msteams`` rather than on the activity,
    and without them the markup renders as inert text and the person is never
    notified."""
